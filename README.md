# Corner Grocer
1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The Corner Grocer program was developed to track and number the frequency of items that were purchased from open to close.   The program would then save these numbers to a .txt file and allow the user to pull from this file to how often certain items were purchased throughout the day.

2. What did you do particularly well?
   I feel most comfortable about the output menu and the ability to navigate throught it without the program outright stopping after selecting an option, as well as the avoidance of an infinite loop.

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
   I feel like my code is fairly long and can tell that someone with more experience could develop the same program with much less code. Efficient code with less lines is always the goal as it results in a program that requires less memory and resources to run.

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
   I've always found that writing methods have been a challenge for me, even more so when there are several methods doing different things. I always turn to YouTube or other friends that are CS majors when I'm having trouble with certain aspects of coding and can usually work through the problem after that.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Coding skills have always been something that I've seen as very transferable. The amount of problem solving, planning, and critical thinking that go into developing a working program is something that you can apply to many aspects of life and work.

6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   As always when I'm coding I try to be aware of the white space and design of the project I'm working on. Making sure that outputs have the correct syntax and layout are key; on the back end though ensuring that your program is neat and ledgible for other developers goes a long way in improving upon the project itself.
